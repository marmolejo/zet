To test the RAM/ROM/video controllers, with the mem map, create a empty
project with these files:
* clocks.xaw
* clock.v
* mem_ctrl.v
* mem_map_test.v
* mem_map.v
* ml403-with-tft.ucf
* ../lcd_display/lcd_display.v
* ../../spartan3an-sk/rtl/vga/char_rom_b16.v
* ../../spartan3an-sk/rtl/vga/ram2k_b16_attr.v
* ../../spartan3an-sk/rtl/vga/ram2k_b16.v
* ../../spartan3an-sk/rtl/vga/vdu.v

And to execute it step by step, substitute in the project the files
mem_map_test.v by mem_map_step.v and ml403-with-tft.ucf by ml403-with-but.ucf
